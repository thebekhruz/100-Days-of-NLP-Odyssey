Numerous communities have dedicated substantial intellectual and financial efforts to creating community-generated digital content (CGDC), aiming to preserve and showcase their local heritage. This endeavour ranges from local museums to distinct community groups, producing rich and multifaceted cultural assets. Despite their value, these digital treasures are at a critical risk of vanishing, needing more technological and organisational challenges.

To ensure seamless access to this wealth of data, developing a method for effectively navigating through it is crucial. This need underpins our project's purpose. Traditional search technologies tend to depend on precise keyword matching, a method that often fails to grasp the nuanced meanings behind user queries. Our project is fueled by the ambition to bridge this divide between the nuances of human language and the computational logic of machines, aspiring to create a search engine capable of interpreting, deducing, and delivering results that are contextually aligned with the user's intentions. Our ultimate aim is to elevate the user experience by offering search results that are not only more accurate and relevant but also inherently intuitive, resonating with the searcher's underlying objectives.
