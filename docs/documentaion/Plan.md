1. Motivation 
	1. What is this project about?
		1. Modern world search engines have been optimised by developing sysytems which can detect the 'meaning' of the query this is also called semantic meaning. In practise this means developing systems which do not rely on  key-value pair search but rather on the whole query. [Perephrase to make it sound better.] This project is exactly about creating semantic search. 
				Further i will refer meaning as semantic as it it more appropriate. 
		1. What technologies were used?
			1. The main technologies which were used are, Python for main logic and neo4j as the data strorage.
			2. I have explored different kinds of ways of calcualting the meaning of the query. The very basic idea is either to use document embeddings and calcualting the simmilairity fof each document, or we can use another algorithm which will use the shortest path idea. For the later to be possible we have tried to create different ontologies and taxonomies. 
2. Write about my data structure.
