The data in `swop_triples.csv` appears to be structured in a tab-separated format with three columns per row, indicating a form of triple storage. Each line seems to represent a relationship or attribute about an entity, structured as follows:

1. **Entity ID**: A unique identifier for the entity (e.g., `a7bb9917-95ff-3f55-a640-4c5afcec25f2`).
2. **Predicate**: The type of relationship or attribute (e.g., `title`, `description`, `mentions`).
3. **Object**: The value or target of the relationship (e.g., text for `title` and `description`, URL for `mentions`).
