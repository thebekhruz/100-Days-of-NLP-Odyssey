To remove data in Neo4j, you can use the `REMOVE` clause. This is used to delete properties from a node.

```
MATCH (learner: Learner {name:'Bekhruz'})
REMOVE learner.twitter
```

- **Step 1:** Similar to updating, first use `MATCH` to find the relevant node.
- **Step 2:** Use `REMOVE` to delete the specified property. Here, we're removing the `twitter` property from the `Learner` node.
