## Understanding Centroids in K-means Clustering ðŸŽ¯

- **Definition**: A centroid is the heart of a cluster in K-means clustering, calculated as the mean of all points in that cluster. It is not necessarily a member of the dataset but rather a virtual or imaginary point that represents the central location of all the data points grouped together in that cluster.
    
- **Role**: Centroids serve as the reference point for assigning data points to clusters. During the clustering process, each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid, and this assignment is based on the minimum distance between the data point and all the centroids.
